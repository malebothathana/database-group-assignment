Bookstore Database Project

Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a database for a bookstore. The database is designed to store information about books, authors, publishers, customers, orders, and more.

Database Design
The database design includes the following entities:

- Books
- Authors
- Publishers
- Customers
- Orders
- Order Lines
- Shipping Methods
- Order History

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD diagram shows the relationships between the entities:

- A book can have multiple authors.
- An author can write multiple books.
- A publisher can publish multiple books.
- A customer can place multiple orders.
- An order can have multiple order lines.

Database Schema
The database schema includes the following tables:

- book
- author
- book_author
- publisher
- customer
- cust_order
- order_line
- shipping_method
- order_history

SQL Code
The SQL code creates the tables, defines the relationships, and inserts sample data.

Outcomes
The outcomes of this project include:

- A well-designed database schema for a bookstore.
- A functional database that can store and retrieve data.
- An ERD diagram that visualizes the relationships between entities.

Tools Used
- DRAW.IO for creating the ERD diagram.
- SQL for creating and querying the database.

Future Improvements
- Adding more tables and relationships to support additional features.
- Implementing data validation and constraints.
- Developing a user interface to interact with the database.

This README file provides an overview of the project, its design, and its outcomes. It also highlights the tools used and potential futureÂ improvements.
